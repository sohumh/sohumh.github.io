Hey! I am an Software Engineer at [Scale AI](https://scale.com) on the Generative AI Team. Before Scale, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I really enjoy thinking creatively, which can be seen in the many unique [puzzles](/creativity/) I've created, the hidden message wordsearch algorithm I built from scratch, or the [cooperative games](https://coopgames.github.io) class I created and designed at Berkeley.

In past summers, I co-instructed [CS 61BL](https://cs61bl.org/su21/staff) and interned as a Software Engineer at Intuit. Over the semesters, I spent much of my time creating teaching [content](/cs61b/) for Berkeley's Data Structures and Algorithms class and playing on the Cal Men's Ultimate Frisbee team.
