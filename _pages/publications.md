First off, for those unfamiliar with 61B, it is *the* data structures and algorithms class at UC Berkeley. I had the privilege of TAing 61B from Spring 2020 to Spring 2022, and over the semesters, I created challenging problems and recorded intuitive videos.

Each unstarred problem below is one I wrote for a past advanced discussion worksheet, and most I recorded a video explanation for as well. The starred problems are ones I didn't write myself, but I recorded a video explanation for. All the video explanations are linked in the solutions.

I also created several content review videos and wrote a few guides, so those are linked as well! All the resources are grouped by topic, and the topics are sorted alphabetically. Some of the topics may not be in scope during your 61b semester.

Finally, if you take advantage of any these resources, I'd love to hear, so shoot me an email at sohum11 (at) berkeley (dot) edu :)
