**Materials Needed:** A phone, or some way of writing down words.

**Players:** 4 or more.

**Objective:** Every player plays for themselves, and the player with the most points after a set number of rounds wins.

**Gameplay:**
- The game is composed of rounds, in which every player is the **judge** once. 
- As the judge, you begin by giving a *prefix* to everyone else.
    - As an example, you could give the prefix `th`. 
- Next, all the other players write down a word starting with the given prefix that they think the judge likes the best.
    - For instance, Avni could write down `thinking` while Maple writes down `thunder`. 
    - If you'd like, you can allow players to write down multiple words, so long as the *one* thing the words are describing requires multiple words. For instance, `third base` is permissible, but `thin celery` is a stretch.
    - To speed things up, the judge could give 30 seconds for each player to come up with a word.
- The words are then relayed to the judge (we recommend preserving anonymity by having one player read all the words out), and the judge ranks the words by how much they like them. 
    - For scoring, if 5 words were given to the judge, the best word awards `5` points, second best `4` points, and so on until the worst word awards `1` point.
    - If you'd like to play with an added bonus, once the words are revealed, the players can guess the ranking order, and if they get it correct, they can get an extra 2 points. 
- Finally, to give due credit, this game is largely based on the wonderful game [Whoonu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranium_Whoonu).
